# Security Policy

## Introduction

The commercetools Connector, developed by [fulfillmenttools](https://www.fulfilmenttools.com), is designed to run on the [commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/overview) integration framework. This connector serves as a foundational application for integrating commercetools Composable Commerce projects and fulfillmenttools OMS.

## Security

In accordance with posted requirements, the fulfillmenttools connector has undergone the [commercetools certification process](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/certification) and has been approved prior to public lease. Specific security requirements are part of this process, including a defined timeline for resolution of reported critical and high vulnerabilities.

While the process certifies the connector, it does not substitute the need to conduct further, ongoing and personalized testing of your holistic product where you utilize this connector. The nature of vulnerabilities in software is that the security landscape changes all the time and continuous scanning is necessary.

You agree to release, indemnify, and hold fulfillmenttools and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any third party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses.
